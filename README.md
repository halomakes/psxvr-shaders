## Common Properties
* **Vertex Crunchiness**: Controls how strong the low-precision vertex snapping effect is.

* **EV Offset**: Compensates material final brightness.

* **Shade Mix**: Mixes between scene lighting and unlit values.  Use this to tone back lighting if it's too strong for your application.

*There is an included [VRCFury](https://github.com/VRCFury/VRCFury) prefab to add controls for these values to your expressions wheel.  Change the animator rewrite path in the main component if your avatar mesh is named something other than "Body".  

## Variants
### psxvr/toon
Mostly flat-shaded but inherits lighting from the environment at the anchor point.  Produces a softer look that's useful for characters and models with higher polygon counts.

### psxvr/shaded
Vertex-shaded variant.  Harsher look that's good for for super-low-poly objects or where you really want to show off the individual polygons. 

## Potential Features to Investigate
* AudioLink support
* Terrain variant with auto subdivision for nearby geometry
